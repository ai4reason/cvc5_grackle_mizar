In the directory `grackle`, there are `cvc5` strategies invented by Grackle
which are mentioned in CICM'24 paper `Solving Hard Mizar Problems with
Instantiation and Strategy Invention`.  The directory `casc_mode` contains the
baseline cvc5 strategies from the CASC competition script.

Minimization
------------

Please note that many of them (those with long hash names) are not minimized
and contain **many** unrelated options.  Some of them (hash codes of length 6)
were minimized by an experimental evaluation (script that removes arguments one
by one and compares performance). Still, some irrelevant options remain.
Further manual minimization was used for the strategies in the paper.
