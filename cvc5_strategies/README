About
=====

In the directory `grackle`, there are `cvc5` strategies invented by Grackle
which are mentioned in CICM'24 paper `Solving Hard Mizar Problems with
Instantiation and Strategy Invention`.  The directory `casc_mode` contains the
baseline cvc5 strategies from the CASC competition script.

Paper notation
--------------

The original names of the Grackle strategies denoted grk_1, ..., grk_5 in the paper
are as follows:

  grk_1    cvc5-2ae3df
  grk_2    cvc5-bcf96e
  grk_3    cvc5-89fc24
  grk_4    cvc5-41cac1
  grk_5    cvc5-94f0df  
  grk_6    cvc5-169baa

Minimization
------------

Please note that many of them (those with long hash names) are not minimized
and contain **many** unrelated options.  Some of them (hash codes of length 6)
were minimized by an experimental evaluation (script that removes arguments one
by one and compares performance). Still, some irrelevant options remain.
Further manual minimization was used for the strategies in the paper.
