Solving Hard Mizar Problems with Instantiation and Strategy Invention

In particular, we publish the cvc5 strategies invented by Grackle and the 6469 problems solved by them (file 00allsolved).

The list of the previously proved 43717 Mizar problems announced in [1] is available at [2] .

The list 00newsolved of the newly solved 3021 *hard* problems (i.e. those not previously proved in [1]) is obtained by subtracting the list at [2] from the list of the 6469 problems solved here by cvc5.
