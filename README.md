Grackle strategies for Mizar
============================

In this repository, we collect strategies invented by the Grackle [3] system
for heuristically minimized Mizar MML problems.

In particular, we publish the cvc5 strategies invented by Grackle and the 6469
problems solved by them (file `00allsolved`).  This are the data accompanying
the paper (to appear) "Solving Hard Mizar Problems with Instantiation and
Strategy Invention".

The list of the previously proved 43717 Mizar problems announced in [1] is
available at [2].

The list `00newsolved` of the newly solved 3021 *hard* problems (i.e. those not
previously proved in [1]) is obtained by subtracting the list at [2] from the
list of the 6469 problems solved here by cvc5.
